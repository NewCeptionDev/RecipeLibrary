# RecipeLibrary

</div>

Did you ever wonder which cookbook the recipe for the dish you want to cook is in?
Or did you want to cook something with your leftovers and wondered if you have a recipe that would work?
RecipeLibrary was built to remove the need to go through every cookbook you own and provide an easy way to find your next recipe.

## What is RecipeLibrary

RecipeLibrary is a software built to keep track of all recipes you own throughout multiple cookbooks.
It enables searchability based on a multitude of parameters.

### Supported Filters

- Parts of or full recipe names
- Cookbooks
- One or multiple ingredients
- One or multiple categories that can be freely defined when adding recipes
- Minimum required rating (also defined when adding or editing recipes)

### Supported Functions

- Search existing recipes based on filters
- Add new recipes
- Edit existing recipes
- Define categories that can be added to recipes to make it easier to find certain recipes
- Add a rating to recipes to keep track of great recipes and recipes you might not need to cook another time

### Supported Platforms

This software is primarily developed on and for windows.
Nonetheless, the software is also packaged and build for darwin and linux and should be working without larger issues.

## What it is not

RecipeLibrary is not a software that contains recipes with their full instructions and pictures, which would make cookbooks redundant.
The purpose of the software is to provide a quick and easy way to find recipes and identify the cookbook they are from.
With this information it should be easy to open the respective page in the cookbook and use the instructions provided there, to actually cook the dish.

## Security Warning

This software was packaged and bundled without a security certificate.
Therefore, the OS might identify this software as unknown and require additional steps to install it.

## Open Source

This project is Open Source.
Pull requests will be reviewed and merged if the change seems reasonable.

You can also always fork the repository and use it as a foundation for your own project.
